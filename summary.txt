Data Model Summary

Schema Type

The project uses a Star Schema.
Fact tables (Sales, Returns) are central and connect to shared
dimensional tables such as Customer, Product, Region, and Date,
This model provides fast aggregation and simple report-building.

Relationship Rationale & Filter Flow

-   Fact tables contain foreign keys linking to all dimensions.
-   Dimensions store descriptive attributes for filtering and grouping.
-   Relationships follow a 1-to-many pattern: Dimension (1) → Fact
    (many).
-   Filter direction flows from dimensions to fact tables.
-   Shared dimensions ensure consistent cross-filtering between
    Sales and Returns.

Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. Date Format Error in Date table

Problem: Power BI read date serial numbers as invalid Date values.
Why: Excel doesn't had the date datatype; it had custom datatype in the date column; Power BI misinterpreted them.
Fix: change the datatype to short date in excel
